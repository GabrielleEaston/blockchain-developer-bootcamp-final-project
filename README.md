# blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project


- The Manager will start a campaign for CrowdFunding with a specific monetary goal and
deadline.
- Contributors will contribute to that project.
- The Manager has to create a Spending Request to spend money for the campaign.
- Once the spending request was created, the Contributors can start voting for that
specific Spending Request.
- If more than 50% of the total contributors voted for that request, then the manager would
have the permission to spend the amount specified in the spending request.
- The power is moved from the campaignâ€™s manager to those that donated money.
- The contributors can request a refund if the monetary goal was not reached within the
deadline.
